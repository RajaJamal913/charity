  <!-- Why Support Anjuman e Saifee Hyderabad -->

      <h3 class="mb-4">Why Our Programs Matter</h3>
      <p>
        At <strong>Anjuman e Saifee Hyderabad</strong>, we uphold the vision of His Holiness Dr. Syedna Mohammad Burhanuddin (TUS) to
        foster community welfare, education, and spiritual growth. Our mission is to maintain mosques, madrasas, and
        community centers while providing essential support—so that every Dawoodi Bohra family can access religious,
        educational, and charitable services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through dedicated programs like Religious Expenses, Community Centers, Deeni Taleem, and Charity &amp; Donations,
        we ensure that mosques remain operational, children receive quality Islamic education, and families in need
        receive medical and housing assistance. Additionally, the <strong>Saifee Run</strong> unites supporters in an annual
        fundraiser to sustain these initiatives and expand our outreach.

            </ul>

              Every runner’s registration fee and sponsorship donation helps us maintain our community centers,
              expand educational outreach, and provide essential aid to families in need. Join us in making a
